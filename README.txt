Tithely is an online giving solution for Churches. This plugin makes it easy to integrate their giving button into your WordPress website.

== Description ==

[Tithely](https://tithe.ly/) is an online giving solution for Churches. They offer giving through their app - but also provide a 'Give' button to be inserted into your website. This plugin makes it easy for you to insert your Tithely 'Give' button into your WordPress Site - using either a Sidebar Widget or a Shortcode.

#Requires SSL Certificate
Whilst Tithely processes payments securely - we recommend you only use the give button on  a page that is protected with SSL encryption. It's pretty cheap to add and usually costs around $30-50 a year depending on the service. Talk to your hosting provider to find out more details.



== Installation ==


1. Upload the 'wp-tithely' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Sign up for your church's Tithely account at [https://tithe.ly/](https://tithe.ly/) and note your 'Church ID'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I Find My Church ID =

Once you register an account and a church with [Tithely](https://tithe.ly/) you will be able to find your Church ID on the 'Website Giving' page. At the bottom there is a little snippet which looks like this

https://tithe.ly/give?c=xxxx

The four digit code (replacing the xxxx) is your Church ID

= How Do I Insert My Button? =

There are two ways you can insert your button.
